                        <p>Multi-threading in Java allows concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program, enabling parallelism and efficient utilization of CPU resources. Threads in Java are lightweight units of execution that run independently and can perform tasks simultaneously. By creating and managing multiple threads, developers can achieve tasks such as improving performance, handling multiple user requests, and performing background operations while keeping the main application responsive. Java provides built-in mechanisms to create and control threads, such as extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface. Thread synchronization techniques like synchronized blocks or methods help in managing shared resources and avoiding race conditions. With multi-threading, developers can design and develop applications that are more responsive, scalable, and capable of handling complex tasks efficiently.</p>
