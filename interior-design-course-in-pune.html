    <h2>Overview</h2>
   
    <p>The Interior Design course is a comprehensive program that equips students with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the field of interior design. The course covers various aspects of design, including spatial planning, color theory, materials selection, furniture arrangement, lighting design, and more. Students learn to create functional and aesthetically pleasing interior spaces for residential, commercial, and hospitality projects.</p>
    <p>The curriculum emphasizes both theoretical and practical learning, allowing students to develop a strong foundation in design principles while also gaining hands-on experience through projects and workshops. Students explore different design styles, analyze case studies, and participate in design critiques to enhance their critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. They also learn to use industry-standard software and tools to create digital renderings, floor plans, and presentations.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">In addition to design skills, the course covers other essential aspects of interior design, such as project management, budgeting, and client communication. Students learn how to collaborate with architects, contractors, and suppliers to ensure successful project execution. They also gain an understanding of building codes, regulations, and sustainability practices to create environmentally friendly and compliant designs.</p>
    <p class="mb-5">Throughout the course, students have the opportunity to work on real-world projects and internships, allowing them to apply their skills in a professional setting. They receive guidance and feedback from experienced faculty members who have extensive industry knowledge. Guest lectures and site visits provide further insights into the industry, exposing students to the latest trends and practices in interior design.</p>
    <p>Upon completion of the course, graduates are equipped with a strong portfolio showcasing their design abilities and project experience. They can pursue careers as interior designers, design consultants, space planners, or work in design firms, architectural firms, or furniture companies. Some graduates may choose to start their own design businesses or specialize in specific areas such as residential design, hospitality design, or sustainable design.

                        <p>Lighting design is a crucial aspect of interior design that greatly impacts the overall atmosphere and functionality of a space. It involves the strategic placement and selection of lighting fixtures to create a desired ambiance, highlight architectural features, and enhance the visual appeal of a room. Lighting design goes beyond simply illuminating a space; it involves careful consideration of the intensity, color temperature, and direction of light to achieve the desired effect.</p>
                        <p>A well-designed lighting plan takes into account various factors, including the purpose of the space, the activities that will take place, and the desired mood or ambiance. Different types of lighting are utilized to fulfill specific functions. Ambient lighting provides overall illumination and sets the general tone of the room, while task lighting is focused and directed to support specific activities such as reading or cooking. Accent lighting is used to highlight architectural details or showcase artwork or decor elements.</p>
                        <p>Lighting designers also consider the color rendering index (CRI) of light sources, which measures their ability to accurately represent colors. Warm light with a lower color temperature creates a cozy and intimate atmosphere, while cool light with a higher color temperature enhances concentration and productivity. The placement of light fixtures, such as ceiling lights, wall sconces, and floor or table lamps, is carefully planned to ensure even distribution and minimize shadows or glare.</p>
                        <p>In addition to functional considerations, lighting design is an opportunity to add aesthetic value to a space. Designers can use lighting fixtures as decorative elements, choosing fixtures that complement the overall design style and contribute to the visual appeal of the room. The interplay of light and shadow can create interesting patterns and textures, adding depth and dimension to the space.</p>
                        <p>Lighting design also extends to outdoor spaces, where landscape lighting can enhance the beauty of gardens, pathways, and architectural features. The use of outdoor lighting techniques, such as uplighting or downlighting, can create a welcoming and safe environment while highlighting the unique characteristics of the surroundings.
                        </p>
                        <p>Overall, lighting design is a critical aspect of interior design that influences the functionality, mood, and aesthetics of a space. By carefully considering the placement, type, and quality of light sources, designers can transform an ordinary space into a visually stunning and highly functional environment.</p>
