                    <h3>Who is this course for</h3>
                    <p>The minimum degree that most IT jobs require is a bachelor's degree. Areas of study for this field include 
                        computer science, information technology, information technology management and computer engineering. </p>
                        <strong>Common courses of study include:</strong>
                        <p>While a college degree still holds weight among management and executive ranks, a shortage of IT workers is 
                            making many firms less choosy over educational formalities.</p>
                            <strong>If you have interest in programming (coding) then you can be suitable for any job role in the IT industry. </strong>
                            <p>Computer background qualification is not mandatory to become an expert in the IT industry, if you have 
                                Mathematics or Physics or Statistics, etc, in your academic, they also are enough.</p>
                                <p>It ranges from two to four years. Students after class 10 can pursue Diploma in Information Technology or <strong>can 
                                    opt for professional IT courses after 12th such as BSc Information Technology, BTech Information 
                                    Technology, MSc/MTech/MBA in Information Technology</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>Why Full Stack training</h3>
                    <p>A full-stack developer is someone who can take care of both the clients and server-side software.  He/she can 
                        handle everything related to the development process from databases, system engineering to client and 
                        server.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, a full stack developer is someone who can take care of a project independently owing to his/her 
                            knowledge of all the stacks required in the development process.</p>
                        <p>Full-stack developers are familiar with each layer of the technology stack, so they can create an entire 
                            functional prototype of an application without any outside help. This makes them especially valuable for 
                            startups that need to release a minimum viable product (MVP) as soon as possible and polish it later. Full-stack developers can jump from one part of the product to another, allowing startups to keep their overhead 
                            minimal</p>
                        <p>Because full-stack developers can work on each layer of an application, they spend more time together, which 
                            helps create chemistry within the company. An experienced team of full-stack developers who know one 
                            another can be significantly more productive and agile than a much larger team of specialists who work in 
                            small, siloed units</p>
                        <p>The demand for full-stack developers is high because they are a valuable asset to any company. Their wide ranging knowledge allows them to be flexible, adaptable, and agile, which are essential skills for working on 
                            software products both in the startup world and elsewhere</p>
                </div>

                <div class="full-stack add-margin show-hide-toggle">
                    <h3>What is full stack development</h3>
                    <p>A full-stack developer is someone who is familiar with all layers of an application. These layers are really 
                        collections of various technologies needed to complete a project, which is where the term stack comes 
                        from.</p>

                        <h4>Presentation layer</h4>
                        <p>Also called the front-end, the presentation layer of an application involves everything thats directly accessible by the end-user. These days, the presentation layer is typically created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and various JavaScript 
                            libraries like React JS, Foundation, Backbone, AngularJS, and Ember.js.</p>

                            <h4>logic layer</h4>
                            <p>Also called the back-end, the logic layer of an application involves any kind of development that doesn t produce a user 
                                interface. Instead, it involves the core logic that makes everything work. Back-end developers are fluent in programming 
                                languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, and .Net</p>

                                <h4>data layer</h4>
                                <p>Sometimes described as a sub-group of the logic layer, the data layer deals with how data is created, read, updated, and 
                                    deleted using databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle</p>

                                    <p>As you can imagine, different projects require different technologies to be completed, so no two full-stack 
                                        developers have the same skills.</p>

                                            <p>The front-end part of all applications forms the user-accessible area. This layer, also known as the presentation layer, covers 
                                                everything available to the user; this front-end operative part of all the applications deal directly with the user interface.
                                                
                                                The stack developer needs to study the skills in front-end technologies like JQuery, CSS3, HTML, Javascript etc.  Added 
                                                learning of Angular and React Js seems to be favorable in hiring prospects.
                                                
                                                Along with that, front-end developers also need to know about web designing, testing, debugging, tools of browsing 
                                                developers, etc.</p>

                                            <h4>HTML</h4>
                                            <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web 
                                                browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as 
                                                JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into 
                                                multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the 
                                                appearance of the document.</p>
                                        </div>
                                        <div class="explain-full-stack-content">
                                            <h4>CSS</h4>
                                            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a 
                                                document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the 
                                                style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and 
                                                XUL.CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and user 
                                                interfaces for many mobile applications.</p>
                                        </div>
                                        <div class="full-stack-extra-features">
                                            <p><strong>CSS saves</strong> - time You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for 
                                                each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want</p>

                                            <p><strong>Pages load faster</strong> - If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a 
                                                tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Easy maintenance</strong> - To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically</p>

                                            <p><strong>Superior styles to HTML</strong> - CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML 
                                                page in comparison to HTML attributes</p>


                                            <p><strong>Multiple Device Compatibility</strong> - Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the 
                                                same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or 
                                                for printing.</p>


                                            <p><strong>Global web standards</strong> - Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good 
                                                idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers</p>

                                            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                                            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages every time 
                                                a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at displaying timely content updates, 
                                                interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 
                                                It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much

                                            <p><strong>Less server interaction</strong> - You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, 
                                                which means less load on your server</p>

                                            <p><strong>Immediate feedback to the visitors </strong> - They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter

                                            <p><strong>Increased interactivity</strong> - You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates

                                            <p><strong>Richer interfaces</strong> - You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich 
                                                Interface to your site visitors.</p>

                                            <p>Back end is the behind-the-scenes of any complex program. Commonly known as server-side, it takes care of the software 
                                                invisible to the user s eye. some of the commonly used back-end languages. Also known as the Logic Layer, this layer deals 
                                                with everything other than the user interface. The data validation part forms the nucleus of this layers core structure. The 
                                                developer here possesses fluent knowledge and expertise in programming languages like Python, PHP, Java, etc.</p>
                                                <p>Along with that, a back-end developer should also be having skills in SQL, Git, Ruby, etc. Backend developers are responsible 
                                                    for maintaining an ecosystem for a websites smooth functions. Back-end developers are responsible for the data storage,

                                            <h4>PHP</h4>
                                            <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely used server-side scripting language that is specifically designed for web development. It provides developers with the flexibility and power to build dynamic and interactive web applications. With its easy syntax, extensive library support, and seamless integration with databases, PHP has become the go-to language for creating robust and scalable web solutions.</p>
                                            <p>One of the most popular frameworks built on top of PHP is Laravel. Laravel is an open-source MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework that simplifies the development process and enables developers to create elegant and efficient web applications. It embraces modern development practices and offers a wide range of features and tools to boost productivity.</p>
                                            <p>Laravel provides a clean and intuitive syntax, making it easy for developers to write clean and maintainable code. It follows the convention-over-configuration principle, reducing the need for repetitive coding and allowing developers to focus on the core logic of their applications. The framework also offers a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, making it seamless to work with databases and perform common database operations.</p>
                                            <p>With Laravel, developers can leverage built-in authentication and authorization systems, making it simple to implement user registration, login, and access control functionalities. The framework also supports caching, routing, session management, and many other essential features out of the box, saving developers time and effort.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                              Laravel has a vibrant and active community, which means extensive documentation, tutorials, and readily available packages and extensions. This ecosystem provides developers with a wealth of resources to enhance their development process and solve complex problems efficiently.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                              In addition to its robust features, Laravel emphasizes code maintainability and scalability. The framework follows SOLID principles and encourages the use of design patterns, allowing developers to write modular and extensible code. This makes it easier to update, maintain, and scale applications as business needs evolve.
                                            </p>

                              <strong>What is HTML?</strong>
                              <p>HTML is an acronym which stands for <strong>Hyper Text Markup</strong> Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications.</p>

                              <strong>What is meant by tags?</strong>
                              <p>HTML tags are like keywords which define how a web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.</p>

                              <strong>What is meant by attributes?</strong>
                              <p>HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes that are the modifier 
                                  of the HTML element.</p>

                              <strong>Introduction to css</strong>
                              <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a 
                                  document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the 
                                  style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.</p>

                              <strong>Types of css</strong>
                              <p>There are 3 distinct methods for styling in CSS, Local style, Page-Level style, and External Styles. Each level of styling is given 
                                  a different hierarchical priority (when to apply) and is used for different reasons.The 3 methods are further grouped into two 
                                  categories. Namely Internal CSS and External CSS. Internal CSS is composed of Local Styles and Page-Level Styles while 
                                  External CSS is just as the name implies.</p>

                              <strong>Box model in css</strong>
                              <p>The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the content itself. 
                                  It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different 
                                  elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model.</p>

                              <strong>CSS fundamentals</strong>
                              <p>Pseudo selectors, styling the text, working with backgrounds shadows,working with float and positions, Aligning the web 
                                  elements using display properties,rotate,scale,translate the html elements using transform properties, make your more 
                                  attractive by adding animations using  transitions and animations properties.</p>

                              <strong>Responsive web designing (RWD)</strong>
                              <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, 
                                  depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. RWD is one approach to the problem of 
                                  designing for the multitude of devices available to customers, ranging from tiny phones to huge desktop monitors.RWD uses 
                                  so-called breakpoints to determine how the layout of a site will appear: one design is used above a breakpoint and another 
                                  design is applied below that breakpoint. The breakpoints are commonly based on the width of the browser.</p>
                              <strong>Flexbox</strong>
                              <p>The Flexible Box Layout Module makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structures without using float or 
                                  positioning.</p>

                              </strong>
                              <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that is widely used for developing interactive web applications. In this paragraph, we will briefly touch upon various topics related to JavaScript.

                                In JavaScript, we start with the classic "Hello, World!" example to introduce the language. It's a simple yet essential starting point for any programming journey.
                                
                                We then move on to discuss the basics of JavaScript, including an overview of the language and its syntax. We explore how to link JavaScript files to HTML documents, allowing us to incorporate JavaScript functionality into web pages.
                                
                                Values and variables are fundamental concepts in JavaScript. We delve into data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, and more. We also cover the different ways of declaring variables using let, const, and var.
                                
                                Basic operators like arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators are crucial for performing computations and making decisions in JavaScript. We explore their usage and importance.
                                
                                Strings and template literals play a significant role in JavaScript for handling text and generating dynamic content. We discuss their features and demonstrate how to work with them effectively.
                                
                                Taking decisions is a crucial part of any programming language. JavaScript provides the if/else statement for conditional execution based on certain conditions.
                                
                                Type conversion allows us to convert values from one data type to another. We explore various methods and scenarios for type conversion in JavaScript.
                                
                                JavaScript has truthy and falsy values that determine the truthiness or falsiness of a given expression. Understanding these concepts is vital for logical operations and conditional statements.
                                
                                Equality operators, such as ==, ===, !=, !==, ??, and ??=, are used to compare values and determine equality in JavaScript.
                                
                                Boolean logic plays a crucial role in programming, and JavaScript provides logical operators like &&, ||, and ! for combining and negating conditions.
                                
                                The switch statement provides an elegant way to execute different code blocks based on different cases or conditions.
                                
                                In JavaScript, we differentiate between statements and expressions, understanding their differences and how they are used in different contexts.
                                
                                Lastly, we explore the conditional (ternary) operator, which allows us to write concise and compact conditional expressions.
                                
                                These topics provide a brief overview of key concepts and features in JavaScript. As you delve deeper into JavaScript development, you will encounter more advanced concepts and techniques that will enable you to build robust and interactive web applications.</p>

                              <strong>Javascript Fundamentals part 2</strong>
                              <p>In JavaScript, there are several additional topics that are important to understand in order to enhance your programming skills. Let's explore these topics briefly.

                                Activating strict mode is an important step to ensure better code quality and prevent common errors. It enables a stricter set of rules for JavaScript code, helping to catch mistakes and enforce good coding practices.
                                
                                Functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript. They allow you to encapsulate reusable blocks of code and execute them whenever needed. We discuss function declarations and function expressions, highlighting their differences and best practices.
                                
                                Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They offer a more streamlined way to define functions, especially for simple one-liners or when using functions as arguments.
                                
                                Arrays are powerful data structures in JavaScript. We explore basic array operations and methods that allow you to manipulate arrays efficiently, such as adding or removing elements, accessing values, and iterating over arrays.
                                
                                Objects are key components in JavaScript. They allow you to represent complex data structures and store related information. We introduce the basics of objects, including object properties and methods, and demonstrate how to work with them.
                                
                                Iteration is a fundamental concept in programming, and JavaScript provides the `for` loop as a common way to iterate over a specific number of times. We discuss how to use the `for` loop effectively and highlight its syntax.
                                
                                Looping arrays is a common task in JavaScript. We explore how to iterate over arrays using the `for` loop and discuss techniques for breaking out of a loop or skipping to the next iteration.
                                
                                Sometimes, it's necessary to loop backwards through an array or use loops within loops. We explore these scenarios and provide examples to help you understand and implement such loops effectively.
                                
                                The `while` loop provides an alternative way to iterate as long as a certain condition is true. We discuss the syntax and provide examples of how to use the `while` loop in JavaScript.

                              <strong>Javascript Dom and Dom manipulations</strong>
                              <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like structure. It provides a way to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages.

                                DOM manipulation involves accessing and modifying elements in the DOM tree using JavaScript. With the help of various DOM methods and properties, we can select elements by their IDs, classes, or tags and perform operations such as changing their content, attributes, or styles.
                                
                                Handling click events is a common requirement in web development. JavaScript allows us to listen for click events on specific elements and define functions that execute when the click event occurs. This enables us to create interactive and dynamic behavior on our web pages.
                                
                                Manipulating CSS styles dynamically is another powerful feature of JavaScript. By accessing an element's style property, we can modify its CSS properties, such as changing the color, font size, or position. This enables us to create dynamic and visually appealing web pages.
                                
                                Working with classes is important for styling and organizing elements. JavaScript provides methods to add, remove, or toggle classes on elements, allowing us to change their appearance or behavior based on certain conditions or user interactions.
                                
                                Handling various events goes beyond just click events. JavaScript provides a wide range of events, such as mouseover, keydown, submit, and more. By listening to these events, we can trigger specific actions or behaviors in response to user interactions, creating dynamic and engaging web experiences.
                                
                                Understanding the DOM and mastering DOM manipulation techniques, event handling, and CSS manipulation empowers developers to create dynamic, interactive, and responsive web pages. By leveraging these capabilities, we can enhance user experiences and build rich web applications.</p>

                              <strong>Javascript Fundamentals part 3</strong>
                              <p>Looping Arrays using normal loops, map, filter, array/object destructuring allows us to iterate over arrays and perform various operations on their elements. With normal loops like for or while, we can iterate through each element and perform custom actions or transformations. Map and filter are higher-order array methods that provide a more concise and functional approach to looping. Map allows us to create a new array by applying a transformation function to each element, while filter creates a new array by filtering out elements based on a condition. Array and object destructuring enables us to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables, making it easier to work with individual elements.

                                Creating DOM elements dynamically is a common task in web development. With JavaScript, we can programmatically create HTML elements, set their attributes and content, and append them to the DOM. This allows us to dynamically generate and modify the structure of our web pages based on user interactions or data.
                                
                                Math, Date, String, and Array functions are built-in JavaScript functions that provide various operations and utilities for working with numbers, dates, strings, and arrays. These functions allow us to perform calculations, manipulate dates and times, manipulate strings, and perform array-specific operations such as sorting, searching, and merging.
                                
                                setTimeout and setInterval are functions that allow us to schedule the execution of code after a certain delay or at regular intervals, respectively. This is useful for implementing timed actions, animations, or periodic updates on web pages.
                                
                                Event listeners are an essential part of interactive web development. By attaching event listeners to DOM elements, we can listen for specific events such as clicks, mouse movements, keyboard inputs, and more. When the specified event occurs, the associated function is executed, allowing us to respond to user actions and create dynamic and interactive behaviors on our web pages.</p>

                              <strong>Javascript Ajax (HTTP requests)</strong>
                              <p>Working with Axios and fetch HTTP request are both JavaScript libraries used for making HTTP requests from client-side applications.

                                Axios is a popular HTTP client library that provides an easy-to-use API for making AJAX requests. It supports various request methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. With Axios, we can send HTTP requests to servers and handle the response data in a convenient manner. It also supports features like request headers, query parameters, request cancellation, and error handling.
                                
                                On the other hand, fetch is a built-in JavaScript API for making HTTP requests. It provides a simpler and more modern interface compared to older approaches like XMLHttpRequest. Fetch uses promises to handle asynchronous operations, making it easier to work with and providing a more intuitive syntax. Fetch supports various request methods and allows us to set headers, handle responses, and handle errors using promises and async/await syntax.
                                
                                Both Axios and fetch are widely used in modern web development for performing AJAX requests to APIs and retrieving data from servers. They offer similar functionalities but have slight differences in syntax and features. The choice between Axios and fetch often comes down to personal preference or specific project requirements.
                                
                                Overall, working with Axios or fetch allows developers to interact with server-side APIs and retrieve data, making it a crucial aspect of client-side web development.</p>

                                <strong>Basics of PHP</strong>
                                <p>PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.</p>
                                <p>Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does "something" (in this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"). The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode.</p>
                                <strong>Super gobal variables in PHP</strong>
                                <p>Some predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function, class or file without having to do anything special.</p>
                                <strong>Arrays in PHP</strong>
                                <p>PHP array is an ordered map (contains value on the basis of key). It is used to hold multiple values of similar type in a single variable.
                                  There are 3 types of arrays in PHP:-
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Indexed arrays</li>
                                    <li>Associative array
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Multidimensional arrays</li>
                                  </ul>
                                </p>
                                <strong>PHP Date and Time</strong>
                                <p>The date/time functions allow you to get the date and time from the server where your PHP script runs. You can then use the date/time functions to format the date and time in several ways.</p>

                                <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.</p>
                                <strong>Encapsulation</strong>
                                <p> This principle states that all important information is contained inside an object and only select information is exposed. The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined class. Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes. They are only able to call a list of public functions or methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data corruption.</p>
                                <strong>Polymorphism</strong>
                                <p>Objects are designed to share behaviors and they can take on more than one form. The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object from a parent class, reducing the need to duplicate code. A child class is then created, which extends the functionality of the parent class. Polymorphism allows different types of objects to pass through the same interface.</p>
                                <strong>
                                  Inheritance</strong>
                                  <p>Classes can reuse code from other classes. Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, enabling developers to reuse common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy. This property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time and ensures a higher level of accuracy.</p>
                                  <strong>
                                    Abstraction</strong>
                                    <p>Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. The derived class can have its functionality extended. This concept can help developers more easily make additional changes or additions over time.</p>

                                <p>Exception handling is a powerful mechanism of PHP, which is used to handle runtime errors (runtime errors are called exceptions). So that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.
                                  Exception handling is almost similar in all programming languages. It changes the normal flow of the program when a specified error condition occurs, and this condition is known as exception. PHP offers the following keywords for this purpose:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>TRY
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>The try block contains the code that may have an exception or where an exception can arise. When an exception occurs inside the try block during runtime of code, it is caught and resolved in catch block. The try block must be followed by catch or finally block. A try block can be followed by minimum one and maximum any number of catch blocks.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    CATCH
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>The catch block contains the code that executes when a specified exception is thrown. It is always used with a try block, not alone. When an exception occurs, PHP finds the matching catch block.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    FINALLY
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>The finally block contains a code, which is used for clean-up activity in PHP. Basically, it executes the essential code of the program.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                  </li>

                                    <ul>
                                      <li>It is a keyword used to throw an exception. It also helps to list all the exceptions that a function throws but does not handle itself.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <strong>Routing</strong>
                                <p>All Laravel routes are defined in your route files, which are located in the routes directory. These files are automatically loaded by your application's App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider. The routes/web.php file defines routes that are for your web interface. These routes are assigned the web middleware group, which provides features like session state and CSRF protection. The routes in routes/api.php are stateless and are assigned the api middleware group.
                                  For most applications, you will begin by defining routes in your routes/web.php file. The routes defined in routes/web.php may be accessed by entering the defined route's URL in your browser. For example, you may access the following route by navigating to http://example.com/user in your browser</p>
                                  <strong>Blade templates</strong>
                                  <p>Blade is the simple, yet powerful templating engine that is included with Laravel. Unlike some PHP templating engines, Blade does not restrict you from using plain PHP code in your templates. In fact, all Blade templates are compiled into plain PHP code and cached until they are modified, meaning Blade adds essentially zero overhead to your application. Blade template files use the .blade.php file extension and are typically stored in the resources/views directory.</p>
                                  <strong>Authentication</strong>
                                  <p>Many web applications provide a way for their users to authenticate with the application and "login". Implementing this feature in web applications can be a complex and potentially risky endeavor. For this reason, Laravel strives to give you the tools you need to implement authentication quickly, securely, and easily.</p>
                                  <strong>Migrations</strong>
                                  <p>Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to define and share the application's database schema definition. If you have ever had to tell a teammate to manually add a column to their local database schema after pulling in your changes from source control, you've faced the problem that database migrations solve.</p>
                                  <strong>Middleware</strong>
                                  <p>Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for inspecting and filtering HTTP requests entering your application. For example, Laravel includes a middleware that verifies the user of your application is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, the middleware will redirect the user to your application's login screen. However, if the user is authenticated, the middleware will allow the request to proceed further into the application.

                                    Laravel includes Eloquent, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database. When using Eloquent, each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table. In addition to retrieving records from the database table, Eloquent models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.
                                  </P>

                                    An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.

                            <p>Let us see what factors affect the salary range of a full-stack web developer. First of all, every hiring organization looks out for 
                                the experience of a candidate. More the experience, the salary they will get. Candidates with updated knowledge and more 
                                skills attached to their portfolio are expected to get more salaries. Candidates with more skills are considered to be preferred 
                                over any factors that influence the salary range. Candidates with skills like problem-solving, product knowledge, project 
                                management, and more will probably get more salary compared to a generic candidate who doesn t know anything other than 
                                development tools and technologies.</p>
                            <p>Regardless of the jobs, the professionals should hone their knowledge and skills around the industry they work in. That gives 
                                them leverage on salary expectations.</p>

                          makes a full-stack developer. This is because there is such a wide variety of languages used in the industry</p>
