                    <h3>Who is this course for</h3>
                    <p>The minimum degree that most IT jobs require is a bachelor's degree. Areas of study for this field include 
                        computer science, information technology, information technology management and computer engineering. </p>
                        <strong>Common courses of study include:</strong>
                        <p>While a college degree still holds weight among management and executive ranks, a shortage of IT workers is 
                            making many firms less choosy over educational formalities.</p>
                            <strong>If you have interest in programming (coding) then you can be suitable for any job role in the IT industry. </strong>
                            <p>Computer background qualification is not mandatory to become an expert in the IT industry, if you have 
                                Mathematics or Physics or Statistics, etc, in your academic, they also are enough.</p>
                                <p>It ranges from two to four years. Students after class 10 can pursue Diploma in Information Technology or <strong>can 
                                    opt for professional IT courses after 12th such as BSc Information Technology, BTech Information 
                                    Technology, MSc/MTech/MBA in Information Technology</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>Why Full Stack training</h3>
                    <p>A full-stack developer is someone who can take care of both the clients and server-side software.  He/she can 
                        handle everything related to the development process from databases, system engineering to client and 
                        server.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, a full stack developer is someone who can take care of a project independently owing to his/her 
                            knowledge of all the stacks required in the development process.</p>
                        <p>Full-stack developers are familiar with each layer of the technology stack, so they can create an entire 
                            functional prototype of an application without any outside help. This makes them especially valuable for 
                            startups that need to release a minimum viable product (MVP) as soon as possible and polish it later. Full-stack developers can jump from one part of the product to another, allowing startups to keep their overhead 
                            minimal</p>
                        <p>Because full-stack developers can work on each layer of an application, they spend more time together, which 
                            helps create chemistry within the company. An experienced team of full-stack developers who know one 
                            another can be significantly more productive and agile than a much larger team of specialists who work in 
                            small, siloed units</p>
                        <p>The demand for full-stack developers is high because they are a valuable asset to any company. Their wide ranging knowledge allows them to be flexible, adaptable, and agile, which are essential skills for working on 
                            software products both in the startup world and elsewhere</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>What is full stack development</h3>
                    <p>A full-stack developer is someone who is familiar with all layers of an application. These layers are really 
                        collections of various technologies needed to complete a project, which is where the term stack comes 
                        from.</p>

                        <h4>Presentation layer</h4>
                        <p>Also called the front-end, the presentation layer of an application involves everything thats directly accessible by the end-user. These days, the presentation layer is typically created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and various JavaScript 
                            libraries like React JS, Foundation, Backbone, AngularJS, and Ember.js.</p>

                            <h4>logic layer</h4>
                            <p>Also called the back-end, the logic layer of an application involves any kind of development that doesn t produce a user 
                                interface. Instead, it involves the core logic that makes everything work. Back-end developers are fluent in programming 
                                languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, and .Net</p>

                                <h4>data layer</h4>
                                <p>Sometimes described as a sub-group of the logic layer, the data layer deals with how data is created, read, updated, and 
                                    deleted using databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle</p>

                                    <p>As you can imagine, different projects require different technologies to be completed, so no two full-stack 
                                        developers have the same skills.</p>

                                        <div class="explain-full-stack-content">
                                            <h4>FRONT END Development</h4>
                                            <p>The front-end part of all applications forms the user-accessible area. This layer, also known as the presentation layer, covers 
                                                everything available to the user; this front-end operative part of all the applications deal directly with the user interface.
                                                
                                                The stack developer needs to study the skills in front-end technologies like JQuery, CSS3, HTML, Javascript etc.  Added 
                                                learning of Angular and React Js seems to be favorable in hiring prospects.
                                                
                                                Along with that, front-end developers also need to know about web designing, testing, debugging, tools of browsing 
                                                developers, etc.</p>

                                            <h4>HTML</h4>
                                            <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web 
                                                browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as 
                                                JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into 
                                                multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the 
                                                appearance of the document.</p>
                                        </div>
                                        <div class="explain-full-stack-content">
                                            <h4>CSS</h4>
                                            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a 
                                                document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the 
                                                style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and 
                                                XUL.CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and user 
                                                interfaces for many mobile applications.</p>

                                        <div class="full-stack-extra-features">
                                            <p><strong>CSS saves</strong> - time You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for 
                                                each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want</p>

                                            <p><strong>Pages load faster</strong> - If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a 
                                                tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Easy maintenance</strong> - To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically</p>

                                            <p><strong>Superior styles to HTML</strong> - CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML 
                                                page in comparison to HTML attributes</p>


                                            <p><strong>Multiple Device Compatibility</strong> - Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the 
                                                same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or 
                                                for printing.</p>


                                            <p><strong>Global web standards</strong> - Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good 
                                                idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers</p>

                                            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                                            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages every time 
                                                a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at displaying timely content updates, 
                                                interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 
                                                It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much

                                            <p><strong>Less server interaction</strong> - You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, 
                                                which means less load on your server</p>

                                            <p><strong>Increased interactivity</strong> - You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates

                                                with everything other than the user interface. The data validation part forms the nucleus of this layers core structure. The

                                <strong>What is HTML?</strong>
                                <p>HTML is an acronym which stands for <strong>Hyper Text Markup</strong> Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications.</p>

                                <strong>What is meant by tags?</strong>
                                <p>HTML tags are like keywords which define how a web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.</p>

                                <strong>What is meant by attributes?</strong>
                                <p>HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes that are the modifier 
                                    of the HTML element.</p>

                                <strong>Introduction to css</strong>
                                <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a 
                                    document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the 
                                    style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.</p>

                                <strong>Types of css</strong>
                                <p>There are 3 distinct methods for styling in CSS, Local style, Page-Level style, and External Styles. Each level of styling is given 
                                    a different hierarchical priority (when to apply) and is used for different reasons.The 3 methods are further grouped into two 
                                    categories. Namely Internal CSS and External CSS. Internal CSS is composed of Local Styles and Page-Level Styles while 
                                    External CSS is just as the name implies.</p>

                                <strong>Box model in css</strong>
                                <p>The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the content itself. 
                                    It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different 
                                    elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model.</p>

                                <strong>CSS fundamentals</strong>
                                <p>Pseudo selectors, styling the text, working with backgrounds shadows,working with float and positions, Aligning the web 
                                    elements using display properties,rotate,scale,translate the html elements using transform properties, make your more 
                                    attractive by adding animations using  transitions and animations properties.</p>

                                <strong>Responsive web designing (RWD)</strong>
                                <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, 
                                    depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. RWD is one approach to the problem of 
                                    designing for the multitude of devices available to customers, ranging from tiny phones to huge desktop monitors.RWD uses 
                                    so-called breakpoints to determine how the layout of a site will appear: one design is used above a breakpoint and another 
                                    design is applied below that breakpoint. The breakpoints are commonly based on the width of the browser.</p>
                                <strong>Flexbox</strong>
                                <p>The Flexible Box Layout Module makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structures without using float or 
                                    positioning.</p>

                                <p>The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the

                                <strong>Inversion of control</strong>
                                <p>Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles 
                                    their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components 
                                    that make up the application</p>
                                <strong>Dependency injection</strong>
                                <p>Dependency Injection is the main functionality provided by Spring IOC(Inversion of Control). The Spring-Core module is 
                                    responsible for injecting dependencies through either Constructor or Setter methods.</p>
                                <strong>Aspect oriented programming</strong>
                                <p>AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does 
                                    this by adding additional behaviour to existing code without modifying the code itself</p>
                                <strong>Autowire</strong>
                                <p>Autowiring feature of spring framework enables you to inject the object dependency implicitly. It internally uses setter or 
                                    constructor injection</p>
                                <strong>Spring bean</strong>
                                <p>The objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A 
                                    bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container</p>
                                <strong>Spring mvc</strong>
                                <p>A Spring MVC is a Java framework which is used to build web applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern. 
                                    It implements all the basic features of a core spring framework like Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection.</p>
                                <strong>Spring boot</strong>
                                <p>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can just run . We take 
                                    an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring 
                                    Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.</p>

                              <p>A full-stack web developer is a person who is skilled in both frontend and backend development of a website. They are 
                                responsible for both the client side and server side of the website. They are professionals who are responsible for the

                                for the program database, servers, and browsers. They are one of the highly paid jobs in the development space.</p>
                              <p>Even though the web development industry is contributing more to the computer science world, people are not aware of 
                                these developers. These developers are relatively new compared to other professionals. This has a lot of potential in it. As the

                                <p>Let us see what factors affect the salary range of a full-stack web developer. First of all, every hiring organization looks out for 
                                    the experience of a candidate. More the experience, the salary they will get. Candidates with updated knowledge and more 
                                    skills attached to their portfolio are expected to get more salaries. Candidates with more skills are considered to be preferred 
                                    over any factors that influence the salary range. Candidates with skills like problem-solving, product knowledge, project 
                                    management, and more will probably get more salary compared to a generic candidate who doesn t know anything other than 
                                    development tools and technologies.</p>
                                <p>Regardless of the jobs, the professionals should hone their knowledge and skills around the industry they work in. That gives

                              <p>A Full Stack Developer, or Full Stack Software Engineer, is a Computer Programmer who uses coding to operate on both frontand back-end systems. Their main duties include creating user interactions on various websites and platforms, writing code 
                                optimized for mobile and developing databases and services for functionality.</p>
                              <p>Full-stack development requires a broad skillset. The best candidates will demonstrate substantial experience within each of 
                                the several areas outlined below</p>
                              <p>There are various differences between a web developer and a full-stack developer. A web developer tends to be specialized in 
                                either front-end or back-end development. A full-stack engineer instead will be proficient across the board, including any 
                                associated areas such as database design/management and DevOps</p>
                              <p>The key to exceptional front-end engineering is a thorough understanding of user experience, and in turn, user interface 
                                implementation. The latter requires a comprehensive understanding of various front-end technologies, the core being HTML, 
                                CSS, and JavaScript. It is also beneficial for the engineer to be familiar with various frameworks and libraries, but the specific 
                                ones are down to personal preference. It s a bonus to have an appreciation/understanding of product strategy</p>
                              <p>Back-end engineering does not require an understanding of user experience, per se. However, it does demand an extensive 
                                knowledge of API principles. This does not necessarily have to be REST, but in most cases, this is the preferred paradigm. In 
                                addition to this, the candidate must excel in at least one back-end technology as well as database design and 
                                implementation. It is also important that the candidate holds more than just a basic understanding of managing relevant 
                                infrastructure.</p>

                             <p>Full-stack developers command a higher salary package than front end or back end developers. Employers are willing to pay 
                              more for a full stack developer because it makes more business sense to hire an individual with front and back end skills, 
                              rather than getting two people to do the same job</p>
