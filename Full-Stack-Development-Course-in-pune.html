              <h3>Who is this course for</h3>
              <p>The minimum degree that most IT jobs require is a bachelor's degree. Areas of study for this field include 
                  computer science, information technology, information technology management and computer engineering. </p>
                  <strong>Common courses of study include:</strong>
                  <p>While a college degree still holds weight among management and executive ranks, a shortage of IT workers is 
                      making many firms less choosy over educational formalities.</p>
                      <strong>If you have interest in programming (coding) then you can be suitable for any job role in the IT industry. </strong>
                      <p>Computer background qualification is not mandatory to become an expert in the IT industry, if you have 
                          Mathematics or Physics or Statistics, etc, in your academic, they also are enough.</p>
                          <p>It ranges from two to four years. Students after class 10 can pursue Diploma in Information Technology or <strong>can 
                              opt for professional IT courses after 12th such as BSc Information Technology, BTech Information 
                              Technology, MSc/MTech/MBA in Information Technology</strong>.</p>

              <h3>Why Full Stack training</h3>
              <p>A full-stack developer is someone who can take care of both the clients and server-side software.  He/she can 
                  handle everything related to the development process from databases, system engineering to client and 
                  server.</p>
                  <p>Essentially, a full stack developer is someone who can take care of a project independently owing to his/her 
                      knowledge of all the stacks required in the development process.</p>
                  <p>Full-stack developers are familiar with each layer of the technology stack, so they can create an entire 
                      functional prototype of an application without any outside help. This makes them especially valuable for 
                      startups that need to release a minimum viable product (MVP) as soon as possible and polish it later. Full-stack developers can jump from one part of the product to another, allowing startups to keep their overhead 
                      minimal</p>
                  <p>Because full-stack developers can work on each layer of an application, they spend more time together, which 
                      helps create chemistry within the company. An experienced team of full-stack developers who know one 
                      another can be significantly more productive and agile than a much larger team of specialists who work in 
                      small, siloed units</p>
                  <p>The demand for full-stack developers is high because they are a valuable asset to any company. Their wide ranging knowledge allows them to be flexible, adaptable, and agile, which are essential skills for working on 
                      software products both in the startup world and elsewhere</p>
          </div>

          <div class="full-stack add-margin show-hide-toggle">
              <h3>What is full stack development</h3>
              <p>A full-stack developer is someone who is familiar with all layers of an application. These layers are really 
                  collections of various technologies needed to complete a project, which is where the term stack comes 
                  from.</p>

                  <h4>Presentation layer</h4>
                  <p>Also called the front-end, the presentation layer of an application involves everything thats directly accessible by the end-user. These days, the presentation layer is typically created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and various JavaScript 
                      libraries like React JS, Foundation, Backbone, AngularJS, and Ember.js.</p>

                      <h4>logic layer</h4>
                      <p>Also called the back-end, the logic layer of an application involves any kind of development that doesn t produce a user 
                          interface. Instead, it involves the core logic that makes everything work. Back-end developers are fluent in programming 
                          languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, and .Net</p>

                          <h4>data layer</h4>
                          <p>Sometimes described as a sub-group of the logic layer, the data layer deals with how data is created, read, updated, and 
                              deleted using databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle</p>

                              <p>As you can imagine, different projects require different technologies to be completed, so no two full-stack 
                                  developers have the same skills.</p>

                                  <div class="explain-full-stack-content">
                                      <h4>FRONT END Development</h4>
                                      <p>The front-end part of all applications forms the user-accessible area. This layer, also known as the presentation layer, covers 
                                          everything available to the user; this front-end operative part of all the applications deal directly with the user interface.
                                          
                                          The stack developer needs to study the skills in front-end technologies like JQuery, CSS3, HTML, Javascript etc.  Added 
                                          learning of Angular and React Js seems to be favorable in hiring prospects.
                                          
                                          Along with that, front-end developers also need to know about web designing, testing, debugging, tools of browsing 
                                          developers, etc.</p>

                                      <h4>HTML</h4>
                                      <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web 
                                          browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as 
                                          JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into 
                                          multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the 
                                          appearance of the document.</p>
                                  </div>

                                      <h4>CSS</h4>
                                      <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a 
                                          document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the 
                                          style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and 
                                          XUL.CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and user 
                                          interfaces for many mobile applications.</p>
                                  </div>
                                  <div class="full-stack-extra-features">
                                      <p><strong>CSS saves</strong> - time You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for 
                                          each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want</p>

                                      <p><strong>Pages load faster</strong> - If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a 
                                          tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.</p>

                                      <p><strong>Easy maintenance</strong> - To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically</p>

                                      <p><strong>Superior styles to HTML</strong> - CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML 
                                          page in comparison to HTML attributes</p>


                                      <p><strong>Multiple Device Compatibility</strong> - Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the 
                                          same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or 
                                          for printing.</p>


                                      <p><strong>Global web standards</strong> - Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good 
                                          idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers</p>
                                  </div>
                                  <div class="explain-full-stack-content">
                                      <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                                      <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages every time 
                                          a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at displaying timely content updates, 
                                          interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 
                                          It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much 
                                          more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>

                                      <p><strong>Less server interaction</strong> - You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, 
                                          which means less load on your server</p>

                                      <p><strong>Immediate feedback to the visitors </strong> - They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter 
                                          something.</p>

                                      <p><strong>Increased interactivity</strong> - You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates 
                                          them via the keyboard.</p>

                                      <p><strong>Richer interfaces</strong> - You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich

                                      <p>Back end is the behind-the-scenes of any complex program. Commonly known as server-side, it takes care of the software 
                                          invisible to the user s eye. some of the commonly used back-end languages. Also known as the Logic Layer, this layer deals 
                                          with everything other than the user interface. The data validation part forms the nucleus of this layers core structure. The
